## Implementing Univariate KDE from scratch

This contains code for univariate KDE in R from scratch.

Implementing the following functions from scratch (i.e., without importing any R libraries):

est.kde.univariate = function(x, sample, bandwidth) {

}

Also generated sample data to play around with to demonstrate the effect of the bandwidth on the resulting KDE
